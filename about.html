        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>In Senior For Senior® we believe in second chances, and that is why we pair you, a Senior citizen, with a Senior dog. You can choose to permanently adopt, foster for some time, or go on a daily walk. It is your choice!</p>
        <p>We are based on the Bay Area, between San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties. We work with more than 25 shelters and their dogs. Our biggest priority is to make sure no dogs will ever be neglected, and every Senior citizen can have a fury friend to be their company. </p>
        <p>Our mantra is to give happiness and love for everyone regardless of their age. We understand that a Senior Citizen may not be able to completely take care of a dog’s basic needs, and that is why we offer a monthly subscription to make sure one of our certified team members go to every location to clean, play, help, and regulate all dogs. </p>
